// My first C++ Program! :D

#include <iostream>                  // in out stream, for sending text to the console.
#include <string>                    // for playerName

using namespace std;                 // so we don't have to type "std::" all the time.

// here is where we start the program
int main() {
    // variables declared at the top is best practice.  
    string playerName;               // variables use camelCase

    // ask the player for their name
    cout << "What is your name, player? "; 

    // assign whatever player types as value of playerName 
    cin >> playerName; 
    
    // greet the player by name
    cout << "Hello " << playerName << "." << endl;

    // user Control+slash to comment out lines.
    // cout << "Hello World!" << endl;  // cout = console out, endl = end line

    return 0;                        // end the program
